## 🔍 Overview

**RespireAI** enables users to record or upload respiratory sounds for real-time analysis. It identifies abnormal acoustic patterns (e.g., crackles, wheezes), classifies conditions (COPD, URTI, bronchiectasis, etc.), assesses severity levels (I–IV), and offers tailored breathing exercise recommendations.
