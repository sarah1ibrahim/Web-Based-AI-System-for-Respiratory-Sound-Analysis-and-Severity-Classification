# Web-Based-AI-System-for-Respiratory-Sound-Analysis-and-Severity-Classification

An AI-driven web platform for early detection, severity grading, and rehabilitation guidance for respiratory diseases using recorded breathing and cough sounds. Designed to support post-COVID recovery and pulmonary health monitoring using only a microphone—no specialized hardware needed.


##  Overview

**RespireAI** enables users to record or upload respiratory sounds for real-time analysis. It identifies abnormal acoustic patterns (e.g., crackles, wheezes), classifies conditions (COPD, URTI, bronchiectasis, etc.), assesses severity levels (I–IV), and offers tailored breathing exercise recommendations.

###  Key Features
- **Record or Upload Audio**  
- **AI-Powered Diagnosis & Severity Grading**  
- **Health Progress Dashboard**  
- **Personalized Rehab Guidance**  
- **Web-Based & Accessible**  
- **User Authentication & Storage**
